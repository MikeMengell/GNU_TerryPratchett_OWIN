OWIN.GNU_TerryPratchett
=======================

ASP.NET5 OWIN Middleware to add the GNU Terry Pratchett Header

Usage
-----

Unfortunately the nuget.org gallery won't accept it quite yet as it's built using NuGet 3.0 for the ASP.Net Core support.  As soon as I can add it then I will but for now the process is a little manual.

0. Download the NuGet package `OWIN.GNU_TerryPratchett` (https://github.com/MikeMengell/OWIN.GNU_TerryPratchett/tree/master/OWIN.GNU_TerryPratchett/dist))
0. Install locally `install-package -Source {folder}\OWIN.GNU_TerryPratchett`

History
-------

The header is a nod to Terry Pratchett living on by his name being echoed around the internet, it's a nod to the book Postal.
